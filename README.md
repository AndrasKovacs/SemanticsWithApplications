Agda formalization and proofs of various parts of Nielson and Nielson's [Semantics with Applications: A Formal Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/Semantics-With-Applications-Introduction-Professional/dp/0471929808).

The repository currently covers chapters 1, 2, 3 and 6, so basically operational and axiomatic semantics (thus leaving out denotational semantics and static analysis).
